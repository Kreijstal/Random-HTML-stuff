I woke up on the bus tired, and the neck sore, I've been traveling from the exams. I didn't expect I was going to be away for so long. When I was with my friend in Cologne things were nice, he listened, and there were no issues or complainings, there was always something to do. I went to Konstanz on the 29th because on the 30th I had to do an exam there, little did you know that at the end I ended up doing absolutely nothing because I didn't prepare for it, I HAD FORGOTTEN MY PHONE'S PATTERN, the crazy thing is that my phone pattern was required to unblock the phone every time and I suddenly forgot it, I could not for the life of me figure out what was the phone pattern again, and I had this phone since 3 weeks, I use it everyday multiple times a day and suddenly I forgot the pattern, how stupid is that?! My phone got locked constantly increasing the time to request the next pattern, "30 minutes", - "Dam" - I say. I take a small notebook and start drawing possible patterns that resemble my forgotten pattern, I try more than 1 combination but they all fail
![A notebook with the forgotten patterns](https://scontent-frt3-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t34.0-12/27591818_10214137474927656_385655755_n.jpg?oh=31e6b48c07364f1be02f4f84133a0ff4&oe=5A741B88 "Patterns") The time is finally over, and I tried a combination which I thought it was correct, wrong pattern, another one, wrong pattern.. one last try.. 1 hour. I decided to fuck it and resetted the phone, I would lose everything but everything was already lost so there was nothing I could do, I had to wake up my couchsurfer and ask for the wifi password, so it started downloading the backed up information. Still it was complete bullshit I had to restart it from scratch, I went to konstanz university only to discovere that the appointment was at 10 not at 11 and it was in another building 40 minutes away from where I currently was. So yes, basically I went to Konstanz for absolutely nothing. My father insisted that I went there to take half exam or something I said, nah they would probably would never take me, I think I was right, but I feel also bad because the true reason I didn't arrive late it was shame, I didn't want to accept the shame of going to a place and do nothing, likewise when I saw my couchsurfer host, I lied to him, I told him I did the exam and that I thought it was okay, he probably didn't care enough about my problems and
