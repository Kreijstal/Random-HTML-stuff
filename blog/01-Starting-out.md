Rant
======

I woke up on the bus tired, and the neck sore, I've been traveling from the exams. I didn't expect I was going to be away for so long. When I was with my friend in Cologne things were nice, he listened, and there were no issues or complainings, there was always something to do. 

I went to Konstanz on the 29th because on the 30th I had to do an exam there, little did you know that at the end I ended up doing absolutely nothing because I didn't prepare for it, I HAD FORGOTTEN MY PHONE'S PATTERN, the crazy thing is that my phone pattern was required to unblock the phone every time and I suddenly forgot it, I could not for the life of me figure out what was the phone pattern again, and I had this phone since 3 weeks, I use it everyday multiple times a day and suddenly I forgot the pattern, how stupid is that?! 

My phone got locked constantly increasing the time to request the next pattern, "30 minutes", - "Dam" - I say. I take a small notebook and start drawing possible patterns that resemble my forgotten pattern, I try more than 1 combination but they all fail
![A notebook with the forgotten patterns](https://scontent-frt3-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t34.0-12/27591818_10214137474927656_385655755_n.jpg?oh=31e6b48c07364f1be02f4f84133a0ff4&oe=5A741B88 "Patterns") The time is finally over, and I tried a combination which I thought it was correct, wrong pattern, another one, wrong pattern.. one last try.. 1 hour. 

I decided to fuck it and resetted the phone, I would lose everything but everything was already lost so there was nothing I could do, I had to wake up my couchsurfer and ask for the wifi password, so it started downloading the backed up information. Still it was complete bullshit I had to restart it from scratch, I went to konstanz university only to discovere that the appointment was at 10 not at 11 and it was in another building 40 minutes away from where I currently was. 

So yes, basically I went to Konstanz for absolutely nothing. My father insisted that I went there to take half exam or something I said, nah they would probably would never take me, I think I was right, but I feel also bad because the true reason I didn't arrive late it was shame, I didn't want to accept the shame of going to a place and do nothing, likewise when I saw my couchsurfer host, I lied to him, I told him I did the exam and that I thought it was okay, he probably didn't care enough about my problems and I didn't want to concern him with my bullshit.

Questions and truth
=========

As explained in the last parragraph, I didnt tell him the truth, because I didn't wanted to appear incompetent, specially with someone I just met.

I've been recently confused about many things, specially wether to talk or not, yesterday when a friend of mine invited to a dinner, I went there, and did nothing, talked to no one, and didn't engage in the conversation, I saw other people talking about many different other topics, and I was just there observing anything being unmotivated to engage. not particularly shy in this case, just not a very strong interest to talk at least with the people in front of me, they didn't seem very interesting, but I felt really awkward while doing that, like being quiet, felt really asocial, I felt people thought I was too quiet, or too boring, or something. because well they don't seem to have interest in engaging either, so what does one ought to do in those situations?

I was also thinking hardly on something that happened in the day so much that I didn't engage with others, but then comes this question: "Are you okay?", and the doubt just makes me freeze, I have no idea what to say, I have no idea if I should trust them or tell them it's fine, I want to say no and talk about my issues, but I don't trust others would be able to understand or more importantly care at all at what my issues are. So I spend a quite big amount of time thinking what I should say or do, discovering that even if I say no, I wouldn't know how to express why I am not okay. I have no idea what to do in this situation and I just look like an idiot.
