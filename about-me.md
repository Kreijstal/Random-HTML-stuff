Me
===
I don't know why or when I made a facebook account, I barely felt the need for it, I was not a very social guy honestly, I was shy, a bit introverted, and eternally curious. 
I don't know why but I was always like the class clown, a bit too immature, a bit on purpose so I can avoid the responsabilities of being an adult. I don't like ambiguities very much. I can pretty much understand everything I'm told but I'm concerned that what others are saying won't be understood by everyone because of such ambiguities, but apparently, ambiguities are here to stay, so is the nature of human languages. I'm very analytical, I like to know, I like to teach, I seem to overwhelm people sometimes with what I know, I've caught myself doing it, but I'm usually too excited or interested to care.
